<h1 align="center"> PROBLEM DEFINITION</h1>
<hr>


   <p>
   A CLEAR PROBLEM DEFINITION is the first and perhaps the mostimportant step toward rationally selecting the best alternative.
   Many dedicated and intelligent individuals have produced elegant solutions for problems other than those they were tasked to solve.
   Therefore, a good executive decision maker participates in problem definition because this step establishes the goal for everything else that
   follows and places a premium on professional judgment.
   </p>
<h2 align="left">It is sub divided into the following phases:</h2> 
    <ul>

	<li><i>Defining the Problem</i></li>
	
	  In general terms, a problem exists when there is a situation that presents doubt, perplexity, or difficulty; or when a question is offered for consideration, discussion, or solution. In the Department
      of Defense, we have a problem whenever we have a requirement or expectation that is not being or will not be met, whether due to inadequate equipment, organization, doctrine,
      training or policy. Our recognition that a problem exists is the first step in describing it in meaningful terms.
	
	<li><i>Organizing The Problem</i></li>
	
	   There are two aspects of organizing the problem that are important to us at the beginning of the Definition Phase. The first is whether and how the problem we are solving fits into a larger picture
       and then how much of that larger picture we have to consider as we proceed. The second is how we want to organize the problem for ourselves and our staff, i.e., whether we want to break
       our problem into smaller pieces that allow different people to work more or less independently on each.
	 
	 </ul>
   <h2> The different types of problem atructures are as follows:</h2>
     <ul>
	 <li><i>Hierarchial Structure</i></li>
	
	 To organize a problem hierarchically, we identify the problem at its broadest level and descend into greater level of detail.
	 With complex problems that we can arrange into a hierarchy, naturally we would like to start with the broadest problem and then solve its descendents. 
	 The inherent danger in this, however, is the sub-optimization that occurs when the broad problem cannot be solved before the descendents. When we 
	 recombine the solutions, the compromises necessary to build a composite alternative tend to move away from the optimal solutions of the individual
	 sub-problems.
     
	 <li><i>Linked Problem Structure</i></li>
	 
	 A set of linked problems requires inter-related decisions because the solution to one problem affectsthe solution of others. If we decide to shift a
	 particular maintenance mission to a reserve component to solve an active component manpower shortfall, then we may exacerbate a readiness problem and 
	 increase the recruiting and training challenges with which the reserves are already struggling.
	
	 <li><i>Sequential Problem Structure</i></li>
	
	 Sequential problems depend on the outcome of a preceding decision to frame and reduce uncertainty about the next problem. Often we can take an 
	 incremental approach toward a complex problem by making a policy adjustment or funding research, evaluating the results, and then proceeding if the effort
	 is worthwhile. This is the essential philosophy of John Boyd's popular Observe-Orient-Decide-Act loop and the concept behind branches and sequels in 
	 military operational planning.

    </ul>
	<h2 align="left">Problem Context</h2>
	<p>
	Force planning and policy problems seldom exist in isolation and their circumstances vary in urgency, magnitude, and importance. We regard a procurement cost 
	overrun as a lesser problem for a weapon system being used in combat now than we would while procuring the same weapon in peacetime. 
	As we examine the problem context, we categorize the factors surrounding the decision as Stakeholders, Triggers, and Influences.
    The stakeholders are those who participate in the decision or are affected by the results of the decision.
    The trigger is the event that necessitates a decision and determines how quickly a decision is needed. 
    If we overlook significant factors as we study the context of a problem, we may over-simplify and thereby degrade the quality of the Definition Phase and ultimately the decision itself.
    If we include too many factors, we create needless complexity and waste resources making our decision. Clearly, after considering the problem's magnitude, 
	importance, and urgency, we must strike a balance between the time available for those involved in the decision to consider a multitude of complex factors 
	and our desire for completeness in describing the problem. Deciding which factors we will consider affects the way we will execute the Analysis Phase, 
	especially the levels of abstraction and simplification we accept in our models.
